# Reinforcement Learning: Cart pole

In this project, both a Q learning and deep Q learning agent is implemented and trained to interact and play with OpenAI gym CartPole enviroment. In the CartPole game, the goal is to balance a pole on top of a moving cart, navigating the system to prevent the pole from falling over. Players aim to achieve a stable equilibrium by strategically controlling the cart's movements, with the objective of maximizing the duration the pole remains upright to score higher points.
